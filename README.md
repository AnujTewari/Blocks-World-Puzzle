# Blocks-World

The overall goal of this project is to implement A* search and use it to solve a classic AI search problem: the "Blocksworld". This problem involves stacking blocks into a target configuration. You are to write a program to solve random instances of this problem using your own implementation of A* search. The focus of the project, however, is to use your intuitions to develop a heuristic that will make solving various instances of this problem efficient.
